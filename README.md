# Bike Sharing Case Study> 
A bike-sharing system in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. It allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## General Information
- 
-Identify the demends of bikes based on the independent variable.
-Help the Management to adapt the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. -->



## Conclusions

- From the box plot we can see the pattern that there is a high demand in Fall and Summer Season

- a unit increase in temp variable increases the bike hire numbers by 0.5471

- a unit increase in yr_2019 variable increases the bike hire numbers by 0.2327units

- a unit increase in season_winter variable increases the bike hire numbers by 0.1323 units
- weathersit_light    (-0.2892 ) (Negative Correlation)
